# Community Committee

The Community Committee is a top-level committee in the CodeDocs JECRC focused on community-facing efforts and work.

## Contributing
The Community Committee is tasked with further building out the CodeDocs Community around the college and locality.

As a part of the CodeDocs Community, we'd love to have your help! To **get started** with contributing, you can check out the [Issues](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues) in this repository. If you have your own ideas on how we could engage and build the community, feel free to create your own issue!

If you're interested in participating in the Community Committee as a member, you should create an issue asking to be an Observer in our next Community Committee meeting.

Community Committee meetings will be broadcast via [Zoom](zoom.us), will be announced ahead of time for access.
